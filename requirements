# Keylogger Requirements

To run the keylogger script, you need to install the following Python packages:

- **pynput**: Library for controlling and monitoring input devices such as keyboards and mice.
- **requests**: Library for making HTTP requests, used for sending data to the Discord webhook.

You can install these packages using pip, the Python package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pynput requests
