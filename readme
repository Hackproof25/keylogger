# Keylogger Script

This Python script implements a basic keylogger that captures keystrokes and saves them to a log file. It also includes functionality to send the log file to a Discord channel via a webhook.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-keylogger-repo.git

2. Install the required Python packages:
    pip install pynput requests

## Usage

1.  Open the 'keylogger.py' file in your preferred code editor.
2.  Configure the Discord webhook URL ('DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL') before use.
3.  Run the script:
4.  Bash
        python keylogger.py
5.  The keylogger will start capturing keystrokes. Press 'Esc' to stop the keylogger.

## Configuration
-- Modify the DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL variable in the script to your Discord webhook URL.
-- The log files will be saved in the logs directory created by the script.

## Explanation
-- The script works by initializing a listener to capture keystrokes using the pynput.keyboard library. When a key is pressed, it appends the keystroke to the keystrokes list. Pressing 'Esc' stops the keylogger, saves the keystrokes to a log file, and sends the file to Discord via webhook if configured.

## Components
-- Imports: Necessary modules such as datetime, os, requests, and Listener from pynput.keyboard are imported.
-- Keylogger Logic: Functions like on_press and on_release handle keystroke capturing and file writing.
-- File Writing: The write_to_file function generates log files based on timestamps.
-- Webhook Sending: The send_discord_webhook function sends log files to Discord using a webhook.
-- Main Execution: The script starts the keylogger and provides console output for debugging.
